How to Optimize Python Code to be 1000 times faster!

- Intro
  - signpost two states of code (or more states)
- Explain problem
- Current State
  - Part 1 problem
  - Part 1 solution
    - already slow
- How to approach this situation?
- What's wrong with this?
  - Part 2 problem
  - quick calculation to show that it's unreasonably slow
  - even if we had a fast processor, it would need TBs of RAM
  - revise units
- Part 2 solution
  - Apply Part 2 to Part 1
- Looking at this problem differently
- Clean up? Prep refactoring
- Debugging, measuring
- Fixing, optimizing
- Conclusion

STATES OF CODE

- Part 1 with glacial Part 2
- Part 1 with half optimized Part 2
- Part 2 applied to Part 1 -- START
- Super Optimized Part 1 and 2
